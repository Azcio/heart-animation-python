Heart Animation in Python

This project is console-based heart animation that displays a heart shape filled with a custom message ("I love you Te Amo").  
The heart is generated dynamically using a mathematical formula â€” no external ASCII art files required!

Features
- Generates a heart shape with pure math (parametric equation).
- Fills the heart with any custom message of your choice.
- Simple animation effect by redrawing the heart repeatedly.
- Works cross-platform (Windows, macOS, Linux).

Skills Highlighted
This project demonstrates:
- Python fundamentals (loops, conditionals, functions).
- ASCII art & math formulas for shape generation.
- String manipulation** for embedding text inside shapes.
- Basic animation techniques using `time.sleep` and clearing the console.
- Git & GitHub usage for project sharing and version control.
